# Visualising the Catalogues of Digital Editions


## Introduction
{: .flex-justify-start }
Digital scholarly editions (DSE) are essential to arts and humanities research, but also, society and culture at large. They are the primary instrument through which textual and cultural heritage, expert knowledge, and public understanding are negotiated. Scholarly editions make documentary materials reliable, adhering to established editorial standards and rigorous intellectual practices to ensure that cultural artefacts are compiled and represented in a fashion that can be considered authoritative. 

DSEs are among the earliest projects in a field that used to be described as humanities computing and is currently mostly referred to as digital humanities (Dalbello 2011). This makes them especially suited for a diachronic approach, describing their change over time. While digital editions can vary greatly in scope and lifespan, a quantitative analysis of two of the most comprehensive data sources on digital editions can produce data-based insight into the developments within the field over time. This longitudinal approach to DSEs also means that historically successful formats for editions will shape the dataset and respective metadata. In practice, this means that most of the editions in the data sources will be based on or modelled after critical editions of text. 

Digital editions are positioned between drawing from archived material, and being an archive themselves (Dillen 2019, 266). In addition to that, digital editions also are web resources in need of archiving, lest they fall subject to link rot and very soon disappear from the web either for the lack of a persistent identifier or lack of maintenance. For digital editions past and present, two main data sources are available. Patrick Sahle lists around 800 editions in a curated catalogue (Sahle 2020), while the Catalogue of Digital Editions features about 320 digital editions in a database (Franzini 2012). Both sources have different criteria for inclusion, overlap in content and differ in granularity, yet these are the sources from which a history of DSEs will mostly draw. Analysis of these sources will present them in their scope, aim and usability for research, while highlighting underrepresented areas of data collection on digital scholarly editions.

DSE in the context of this paper are best defined using Patrick Sahle’s definition of editions as the “critical representation of historic documents'' (Sahle 2016). This definition is best suited for the editions described in both data sources, as Sahle compiled the first list of digital editions and the Dig-Ed-Cat explicitly refers to Sahle’s work as the basis of their data collection. These data sources from part of a response to Joris van Zundert, who calls on theorists and practitioners to “intensify the methodological discourse” necessary to “implement a form of hypertext that truly represents textual fluidity and text relations in a scholarly viable and computational tractable manner” (2016: 106) “Without that dialogue,” he warns, “we relegate the raison d’être for the digital scholarly edition to that of a mere medium shift, we limit its expressiveness to that of print text, and we fail to explore the computational potential for digital text representation, analysis and interaction.” This dialogue has begun in earnest (Driscoll and Pierazzo 2016; Boot et al. 2017), but a previous survey on the expectations and use of digital editions found that user needs are seldom satisfied by such resources (Franzini, Terras, and Mahony 2019). This dialogue can be augmented by the availability of data-driven insight into the development of digital scholarly editions over time, as well as an assessment of the scope and potential use of data sources for research on digital editions.

Digital editions have a long history of adapting to new challenges and possibilities presented by both changes in computational methods and research policy. While earlier DSEs were distributed through physical media, such as a CD-ROM sold through a publisher, digital platforms and browser-based access has become the standard practice for digital scholarly editions. With recent changes in EU funding directives, the majority of recent digital editions are based on open access models, further increasing accessibility of digital editions. Similarly, digital platforms providing metadata about digital editions can extend the accessibility of scholarly editing by providing the data from which to construct a history of digital scholarly editing and editions.

Exploring this history and at the same time assessing the available metadata on DSEs is the aim of this section. It presents the state of the two most comprehensive available sources on digital editions and details the methodology and visualisation process undertaken. This section is part of the larger C21 Editions project , a three-year international collaboration jointly funded by the Arts & Humanities Research Council (AH/W001489/1) and Irish Research Council (IRC/W001489/1).
