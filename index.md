## Introduction
Digital scholarly editions are essential to arts and humanities research, but also, society and culture at large. They are the primary instrument through which textual and cultural heritage, expert knowledge, and public understanding are negotiated. Scholarly editions make documentary materials reliable, adhering to established editorial standards and rigorous intellectual practices to ensure that cultural artefacts are compiled and represented in a fashion that can be considered authoritative. 

Digital scholarly editions are among the earliest projects in a field that used to be described as humanities computing and is currently mostly referred to as digital humanities. This makes digital scholarly editions especially suited for a diachronic approach, describing their change over time. While digital editions can vary greatly in scope and lifespan, a quantitative analysis of two of the most comprehensive data sources on digital editions can produce data-based insight into the developments within the field over time. This longitudinal approach to digital scholarly editions also means that historically successful formats for editions will shape the dataset and respective metadata. In practice, this means that most of the editions in the data sources will be based on or modelled after critical editions of text. 

Digital scholarly editions in the context of this paper are best defined using Patrick Sahle’s definition of editions as the “critical representation of historic documents''. This definition is best suited for the editions described in both data sources, as Sahle compiled the first list of digital editions and the Dig-Ed-Cat explicitly refers to Sahle’s work as the basis of their data collection. 

Digital platforms extend the accessibility of scholarly editing. While earlier digital scholarly editions were distributed through physical media, such as a CD-ROM sold through a publisher, digital platforms and browser-based access has become the standard practice for digital scholarly editions. With recent changes in EU funding directives, the majority of recent digital editions are based on open access models, further increasing accessibility of digital editions. Similarly, digital platforms providing metadata about digital editions can extend the accessibility of scholarly editing by providing the data from which to construct a history of digital scholarly editing and editions.

Exploring this history and at the same time assessing the available metadata on digital scholarly editions is the aim of this section. It presents the state of the two most comprehensive available sources on digital editions and details the methodology and visualisation process undertaken. This section is part of the larger C21 Editions project (c21editions.org), a three-year international collaboration jointly funded by the Arts & Humanities Research Council (AH/W001489/1) and Irish Research Council (IRC/W001489/1).
